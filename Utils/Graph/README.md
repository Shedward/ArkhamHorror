# Graph

Basic graph implementation for storing zone connections and other relation graphs. 

## Goals and priorities

1. More "natural" API for working with maps/streets/playfields/quest_trees over mathematical correctness and universality. 
2. Simplicity over performance. (Since average size of graphs will be pretty small and time to implement it is short).
3. Abstract enough to be potentially usefull in other places.
4. Since it pretty important logical part it should be fully covered with tests.
